A very simple OSC driven scrolling spectrogram like window.

Listens on port 4321 for any messages of the form
/multiplot:f*

All input data is transformed into zero mean and unit variance and then plotted.
Up to 32 concurrent plots are supported at once.

WARNING:: This is a development/debugging tool with prealpha quality.
          If you need to plot moderate rate OSC signals in a scrolling plot,
          this should be hackable for what you want, though don't expect it to
          be pretty.

Hacking Ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add in color map support within insertCol()
- Add grid or fill for multiplot API
- Get /raw_data api to work which should allow for manual specification of RGB
  column data
- Perhaps allow for appending rows rather than cols (simple enough, though it
  might not be too useful given normal screen dimensions)
- Allow for startup selection of number of channels and sizing of window.
- Permit non-compile time switch to use FFT or to use direct data (or better
  yet, make an external program to do the FFT and then use the /raw_data API)
